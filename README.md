## Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis is conceptualized by tradition as the statistical study of experiments in which multiple measurements are made on each experimental unit and for which the relationship among multivariate measurements and their structure is important to the experiment's understanding. For instance, in analyzing financial instruments, the relationships among the various characteristics of the instrument are critical (Olkin 2001)
